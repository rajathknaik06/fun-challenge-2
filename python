""" Develop a program that evaluates the strength of a given password and categorizes it as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong" based on specific criteria.



"Strong: Password is strong.": If the password meets all the character type requirements (uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character) and is at least 8 characters long.
"Moderate: Password is moderately strong.": If the password meets at least one of the character type requirements (either uppercase, lowercase, digit, or special character) but does not meet all of them or is at least 8 characters long.
"Weak: Password is too short.": If the password is shorter than 8 characters in length.


Function Signature: password_strength(password)



Use global variables:

has_uppercase = False

has_lowercase = False

has_digit = False

has_special_char = False

Input format :
The input consists of a string representing the password to be evaluated. The password can contain letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters.

Output format :
The output displays any of the following:

"Strong: Password is strong." if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.

"Moderate: Password is moderately strong." if the password meets some, but not all, of the strong password criteria.

"Weak: Password is too short." if the password is less than 8 characters long."""
